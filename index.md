## Setting up the LiveUSB

The first step is to find a USB with atleast 32GB on it. 64GB or more is prefered.

### WintoUSB

WinToUSB is a program that allows for you to install Windows 10 to a USB for free. 
[Download WinToUSB](https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/downloads/WinToUSB_Free.exe)

### Windows 10 ISO

The next step is to get a Windows 10 ISO file to flash onto the USB. The iso can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

**EDIT**: To download the ISO instead of the Media Creation Tool, you must be using any device that is not Windows. However, if all you have is Windows PCs, [follow these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/)

### Flashing the Windows 10 ISO

This is where you will begin setting up the computer for use.
- Plug the USB into your computer and open **WinToUSB**. 
- On the first page, find and select your Windows 10 ISO you downloaded.

**NOTE**: You will be asked to select a version, as I didn't upload the ISO I do not have this list. Select Windows 10 Home.
- On the next page you will get a list of options, select **Legacy** and **GPT for EUFI**.
- Wait for the process to reach 100% done, then eject your USB.
