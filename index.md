## Setting up the Live USB

The first step is to find a USB with atleast 32GB on it. 64GB or more is prefered.

### WintoUSB

WinToUSB is a program that allows for you to install Windows 10 to a USB for free. 
[Download WinToUSB](https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/downloads/WinToUSB_Free.exe)

### Windows 10 ISO

The next step is to get a Windows 10 ISO file to flash onto the USB. The iso can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

**EDIT**: To download the ISO instead of the Media Creation Tool, you must be using any device that is not Windows. However, if all you have is Windows PCs, [follow these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/)

### Flashing the Windows 10 ISO

This is where you will begin setting up the computer for use.
- Plug the USB into your computer and open **WinToUSB**. 
- On the first page, find and select your Windows 10 ISO you downloaded.

**NOTE**: You will be asked to select a version, as I didn't upload the ISO I do not have this list. Select Windows 10 Home.
- On the next page you will get a list of options, select **Legacy** and **GPT for EUFI**.
- Wait for the process to reach 100% done, then eject your USB.

## Booting to the Live USB

The next step in the process is to boot to the USB after setting it up.

### Start Up & Setup

**Instructions**:
- Restart your laptop.
- When you see it start to boot up, press F9 until you get a boot device selection window.
- Select your USB from the list and wait for the computer to start.
- Next you will have to go through the Windows 10 Setup. This will take about 20-30 min.

### Sidenote

You will have to repeat this process everytime you wish to boot to the USB. 

Do not unplug the USB while using it, this will crash the system, and potentially corrupt data.

## Installing Software

Installing software is important to do so you can disguise this liveUSB as a school computer, while bypassing the school's blocking system.

### School Software

This step is important to disguise this computer as a school computer. This also allows you to use the USB alone instead of switching inbetween the two.

One of the most used software that the school uses is Teams and OneNote. I will include a link to office, where you can download the Office 365 software.

**Software Downloads**:
- [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-teams/download-app#desktopAppDownloadregion)
- [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/download)
- [Microsoft 365 (Online, not a download)](https://www.office.com/)

### Bypassing Software

This software will allow you to bypass the WiFi restrictions. 

**NOTE**: If you have a Windows 10 Product Key, do not use it on the Live USB, as it may bug and render it invalid.

**NOTE 2**: Using cracked software to activate Windows 10 is illegal. **I do not condone the use of activation software, and if you use such programs I am not responsible**.

Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or a Proxy will allow you to access restricted sites. Installing a VPN on the school computer isn't allowed, however there are no restrictions on personal computers. Your Live USB would be considered a personal computer. The following is a list of popular VPNs:
- NordVPN
- Avast SecureLine
- Surfshark
- ProtonVPN
- ExpressVPN

The listed VPNs are payed software, as free VPNs can sell your data and/or have spyware. The price of a good VPN is worth it when it comes to your security online. After you've setup or signed into the VPN, you are done with this step.

## Final steps & Precautions

### Social Media Usage

Do not use or browse social media such as Twitter, Instagram, etc. while in class. First off, your going to very easily give away that something is off. Second, your education is important, which is rich coming from me. 

### Downloading Software & Games

Do whatever you want, it is your computer afterall. Using the VPN you will be able to play online games and use popular game platforms. (Ex: Steam) With the VPN you are also able to access minecraft servers. Basically, you can do anything you could do on your home WiFi.
