## Setting up the LiveUSB

The first step is to find a USB with atleast 32GB on it. 64GB or more is prefered.

### WintoUSB

WinToUSB is a program that allows for you to install Windows 10 to a USB for free. 
[Download WinToUSB](https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/downloads/WinToUSB_Free.exe)

### Windows 10 ISO

The next step is to get a Windows 10 ISO file to flash onto the USB. The iso can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).
EDIT: To download the ISO instead of the Media Creation Tool, you must be using any device that is not Windows. However, if all you have is Windows PCs, [follow these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/)
